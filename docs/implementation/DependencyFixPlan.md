# Dependency and Module Fix Plan

**Author:** Documentation Team  
**Date:** April 19, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to address several technical debt issues identified in the Agentic AI Framework codebase. These issues include non-existent module references, build configuration inconsistencies, placeholder implementations, and integration test setup problems.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Non-existent Module References

The codebase contains references to modules that don't exist:

- **modules/demo**: Referenced in VSCode tabs but doesn't exist in the filesystem or build configuration.

**Fix Plan:**
- Remove references to non-existent modules from documentation
- Update IDE configurations to remove non-existent module references
- Ensure all referenced modules exist in the filesystem and build configuration

### 2. Build Configuration Inconsistencies

There are inconsistencies in the build configuration across modules:

- **ZIO HTTP Versions**: Different modules use different versions of ZIO HTTP:
  - Dashboard module: ZIO HTTP 3.0.0-RC2
  - HTTP module: ZIO HTTP 3.0.0-RC2
  - Workflow Demo module: ZIO HTTP 3.0.0-RC4

**Fix Plan:**
- Standardize on a single version of ZIO HTTP across all modules
- Update all module build files to use the standardized version
- Test all modules with the standardized version to ensure compatibility
- Document any necessary workarounds if full standardization isn't immediately possible

### 3. Placeholder Implementations in Langchain4j Module

The Langchain4j module contains placeholder implementations for some features:

- **Tool Support**: Marked as "Planned" (ðŸ”®) but referenced in documentation
- **Advanced Langchain4j Features**: Some features marked as "In Progress" (ðŸš§)

**Fix Plan:**
- Clearly document the status of each feature in the Langchain4j module
- Prioritize implementation of critical features
- Create a roadmap for implementing remaining features
- Update documentation to accurately reflect the current state of implementation

### 4. Workflow Demo Module Configuration Issues

The Workflow Demo module has configuration issues:

- **Dependency Decoupling**: Temporarily removed dependencies on core and memory modules
- **ZIO HTTP Version**: Uses a different version than other modules

**Fix Plan:**
- Document the current workaround in the troubleshooting guide
- Create a plan to properly integrate with core and memory modules
- Test the integration to ensure compatibility
- Update the build configuration once integration is successful

### 5. Integration Tests Module Integration

There are issues with the integration tests setup:

- **Dual Structure**: Two separate integration test setups (`it/` and `modules/integration-tests/`)
- **Build Integration**: The `it` module is commented out in the main build.sbt aggregation

**Fix Plan:**
- Document the current integration test setup
- Create a plan to consolidate the integration test structure
- Update the build configuration to properly include integration tests
- Ensure all integration tests are properly executed in the CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Documentation Updates (Completed)

- âœ… Update README.md to remove references to non-existent modules
- âœ… Update ProjectStructure.md to accurately reflect the current module structure
- âœ… Update Langchain4jIntegration.md to clarify the status of placeholder implementations
- âœ… Create IntegrationTestsSetup.md to document the current integration test setup
- âœ… Update WorkflowDemo_TroubleshootingGuide.md to document configuration issues

### Phase 2: Build Configuration Standardization (Weeks 1-2)

- Standardize ZIO HTTP version across all modules
- Update all module build files to use the standardized version
- Test all modules with the standardized version
- Document any necessary workarounds

### Phase 3: Module Integration (Weeks 3-4)

- Properly integrate Workflow Demo with core and memory modules
- Consolidate integration test structure
- Update build configuration to properly include integration tests
- Test all integrations to ensure compatibility

### Phase 4: Feature Implementation (Weeks 5-8)

- Implement missing features in Langchain4j module
- Update documentation to reflect new implementations
- Create comprehensive tests for new features
- Ensure all modules pass tests and compile successfully

## Success Criteria

The following criteria will be used to determine the success of this plan:

1. **Documentation Accuracy**: All documentation accurately reflects the current state of the codebase
2. **Build Consistency**: All modules use consistent versions of dependencies
3. **Module Integration**: All modules are properly integrated and can be used together
4. **Test Coverage**: All modules have comprehensive tests that pass
5. **Feature Completeness**: All planned features are implemented or have a clear implementation plan

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risks

1. **Dependency Conflicts**: Standardizing dependencies may cause conflicts with existing code
2. **Integration Complexity**: Integrating modules may be more complex than anticipated
3. **Feature Implementation Challenges**: Implementing missing features may be more difficult than expected
4. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Some areas may lack adequate test coverage

### Mitigations

1. **Incremental Approach**: Implement changes incrementally and test thoroughly at each step
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure all changes are thoroughly tested before merging
3. **Documentation**: Document all changes and any workarounds needed
4. **Code Reviews**: Ensure all changes are reviewed by appropriate team members

## Conclusion

Addressing these technical debt issues will improve the maintainability, reliability, and usability of the Agentic AI Framework. By following this plan, we can ensure that the codebase is consistent, well-documented, and properly integrated.
