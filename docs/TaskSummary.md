   - Updated main documentation index
   - Reorganized documentation structure
   - Improved navigation and discoverability
   - Documented documentation maintenance process

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is now organized into a clear hierarchy:

```
docs/
├── README.md                 # Documentation index
├── architecture/             # Architectural documentation
│   ├── ComponentRelationships.md
│   ├── ProjectStructure.md
│   └── README.md
├── api/                      # API documentation
│   ├── Agents.md
│   ├── Core.md
│   ├── HTTP.md
│   ├── Langchain4j.md
│   ├── Memory.md
│   ├── Mesh.md
│   └── README.md
├── guides/                   # User and developer guides
│   ├── CreatingCustomAgents.md
│   ├── DeveloperOnboarding.md
│   └── DeploymentGuide.md
└── troubleshooting/          # Troubleshooting guides
    └── TroubleshootingGuide.md
```

Each module also has its own README:

```
modules/
├── agents/README.md
├── core/README.md
├── examples/README.md
├── http/README.md
├── integration-tests/README.md
├── langchain4j/README.md
├── memory/README.md
└── mesh/README.md
```

## Impact of Documentation Improvements

These documentation improvements provide several benefits:

1. **Reduced Onboarding Time**: New developers can quickly understand the framework
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Consistent documentation makes future updates easier
3. **Better Troubleshooting**: Comprehensive guides help users solve issues faster
4. **Clearer Architecture**: Visual representations help understand component relationships
5. **Consistent Standards**: Uniform structure and style across documentation
6. **Easier Navigation**: Clear organization makes finding information simpler

## Future Documentation Work

While significant improvements have been made, some areas could benefit from further documentation work in the future:

1. **Video Tutorials**: Create screencast tutorials for common workflows
2. **Interactive Examples**: Develop interactive examples that users can run in a web browser
3. **Case Studies**: Document real-world use cases and implementation patterns
4. **Performance Guide**: Create detailed performance tuning guidelines
