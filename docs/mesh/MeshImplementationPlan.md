## Integration with Existing Framework

### Memory System Integration

The mesh network will integrate with the existing memory system to provide distributed memory capabilities:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Node 1"
        A1[Agent] --- M1[Memory System]
        M1 --- MS1[Mesh Sync]
    end
    
    subgraph "Node 2"
        A2[Agent] --- M2[Memory System]
        M2 --- MS2[Mesh Sync]
    end
    
    MS1 <--> MS2
```

### LLM Integration

LLM-based agents will be deployable to the mesh network, enabling distributed AI processing:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Node 1"
        C[Claude Agent] --- AM1[Agent Mesh]
    end
    
    subgraph "Node 2"
        V[Vertex AI Agent] --- AM2[Agent Mesh]
    end
    
    AM1 <--> AM2
    
    subgraph "Client"
        App[Application] --- AM1
        App --- AM2
    end
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Test each component in isolation
   - Mock dependencies for controlled testing
   - Verify behavior against specifications

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test communication between components
   - Verify end-to-end workflows
   - Test with different node configurations

3. **Performance Testing:**
   - Measure throughput and latency
   - Test with varying load patterns
   - Identify bottlenecks and optimize

4. **Resilience Testing:**
   - Simulate node failures
   - Test recovery mechanisms
   - Verify system behavior under stress

## Key Components Detailed Specifications

### HTTP Protocol

The HTTP protocol implementation provides:

- Agent deployment via HTTP POST
- Remote agent calling with serialized inputs/outputs
- Message passing between nodes
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

Example flow for remote agent call:

```scala
// Client code
val remoteAgent = mesh.getRemoteAgent(agentRef)
val result = remoteAgent.process("input data")

// Translates to:
// 1. Serialize "input data"
// 2. HTTP POST to /agents/{id}/call with serialized data
// 3. Remote node executes agent with deserialized input
// 4. Serialize result and return
// 5. Deserialize result and return to client
```

### Agent Directory

The agent directory provides:

- Registration of agents with capabilities
- Discovery of agents by ID or capabilities
- Status tracking for agents
- Events for agent lifecycle

Example of capability-based discovery:

```scala
// Find agents with specific capabilities
val textProcessors = directory.findAgentsByCapabilities(
  Set("text-processing", "translation")
)

// Find the best agent for a task
val bestTranslator = textProcessors
  .filter(_.capabilities.contains("translation"))
  .sortBy(_.metadata.get("accuracy").map(_.toDouble).getOrElse(0.0))
  .headOption
```
