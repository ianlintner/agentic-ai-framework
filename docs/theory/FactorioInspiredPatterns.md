# Factorio-Inspired Design Patterns

This document outlines additional design patterns inspired by Factorio game mechanics that we'll implement in our framework.

## Train Signaling System

In Factorio, trains navigate complex rail networks using a signaling system that prevents collisions and manages traffic flow. While ZIO provides semaphores for basic resource management, we can extend this concept to create more sophisticated scheduling and routing.

### Core Components

#### 1. Rail Blocks
Segments of track that can contain at most one train at a time, similar to protected resources in concurrent programming.

```scala
class RailBlock[A] {
  // Acquire exclusive access to the block
  def enter: ZIO[Any, Throwable, Unit] 
  
  // Release the block
  def exit: UIO[Unit]
  
  // Check if block is occupied
  def isOccupied: UIO[Boolean]
  
  // Get current resource
  def current: UIO[Option[A]]
}
```

#### 2. Rail Signals
Control flow into rail blocks, ensuring only one train can enter a block at a time.

```scala
trait RailSignal[A] {
  // Try to pass the signal (blocking if unable)
  def pass(resource: A): ZIO[Any, Throwable, Unit]
  
  // Check if passage is allowed without blocking
  def canPass: UIO[Boolean]
  
  // Reset the signal state
  def reset: UIO[Unit]
}
```

#### 3. Chain Signals
Look ahead to subsequent signals, allowing for more complex routing logic.

```scala
class ChainSignal[A](nextSignals: List[RailSignal[A]]) extends RailSignal[A] {
  // Only allows passage if all subsequent signals allow passage
  override def canPass: UIO[Boolean] = {
    ZIO.foldLeft(nextSignals)(true)((acc, signal) => 
      if (!acc) ZIO.succeed(false) else signal.canPass)
  }
}
```

### Use Cases

1. **Resource Scheduling**: Manage access to expensive resources like API rate limits or database connections
2. **Workflow Orchestration**: Control complex sequences of operations with dependencies
3. **Batch Processing**: Coordinate movement of data through various processing stages

## Belt Transport System

Factorio's belt system moves items at predictable rates with known throughput limits. This can inspire our data streaming implementation with rate limiting, prioritization, and load balancing.

### Core Components

#### 1. Transport Belt
Moves data at a controlled rate with a maximum throughput.

```scala
class TransportBelt[A](itemsPerSecond: Int) {
  // Add item to the belt
  def insert(item: A): ZIO[Any, Throwable, Boolean]
  
  // Take the next item from the belt
  def take: ZIO[Any, Throwable, A]
  
  // Check current load
  def currentLoad: UIO[Int]
  
  // Check if belt is full
  def isFull: UIO[Boolean]
}
```

#### 2. Splitter
Evenly distributes items between multiple output belts.

```scala
class Splitter[A](outputs: List[TransportBelt[A]]) {
  // Distribute an item across outputs using round-robin
  def distribute(item: A): ZIO[Any, Throwable, Boolean]
  
  // Balance loads across output belts
  def balance: ZIO[Any, Throwable, Unit]
}
```

#### 3. Priority Splitter
Directs items with preference to a specific output.

```scala
class PrioritySplitter[A](priority: TransportBelt[A], secondary: TransportBelt[A]) {
  // Send to priority first if possible, otherwise to secondary
  def distribute(item: A): ZIO[Any, Throwable, Boolean]
}
```

#### 4. Filter
Only allows certain items to pass based on a predicate.

```scala
class BeltFilter[A](predicate: A => Boolean, output: TransportBelt[A]) {
  // Only pass items that match the predicate
  def process(item: A): ZIO[Any, Throwable, Boolean]
}
```

### Use Cases

1. **Stream Processing**: Control dataflow rates to prevent overwhelming downstream systems
2. **Load Balancing**: Distribute work evenly across multiple workers
3. **Priority Queuing**: Ensure critical items get processed first
4. **Data Filtering**: Efficiently route different data types to appropriate handlers

## Integration with Circuit Networks

These new patterns will integrate with our existing circuit network patterns:

1. **Signal Combinators**: Use circuit combinator logic to control train signals
2. **Belt Content Reading**: Monitor belt contents using memory cells
3. **Flow Control**: Use circuit networks to enable/disable belts and signals based on conditions
4. **Throughput Calculation**: Measure and optimize system performance

## Performance Characteristics

1. **Throughput**: Both train and belt systems have measurable maximum throughput
2. **Latency**: Each component adds predictable latency
3. **Backpressure**: Systems handle capacity limits through blocking or buffering
4. **Resource Utilization**: Circuits monitor and optimize resource usage

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement core interfaces and basic components
2. Add monitoring and metrics collection
3. Create testing framework for throughput and correctness validation
4. Develop visualization tools for system state
5. Build example applications demonstrating common patterns
