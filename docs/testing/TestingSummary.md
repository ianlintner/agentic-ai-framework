# Testing Overview for Agentic AI Framework

This document provides an overview of the testing strategy and test coverage for the Agentic AI Framework. It serves as a guide to understanding what components are tested and how they are tested.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized according to the framework's modular architecture:

- **Memory System Tests**: Tests for memory cells, monitoring, and cleanup strategies
- **Circuit Pattern Tests**: Tests for agent circuit components and combinators
- **LLM Integration Tests**: Tests for large language model integrations
- **Application Tests**: Tests for example applications built on the framework

## Memory System Tests

### MemorySystemSpec.scala

Tests the fundamental operations of the memory system:

- Memory cell creation and management
- Cell tagging and tag-based retrieval
- Various cleanup strategies including:
  - Time-based cleanup (for old cells)
  - Size-based cleanup (for large cells)
  - Tag-based cleanup (for cells with specific tags)
- Memory system factory methods and configuration

### AutomaticCleanupSpec.scala

Tests the automatic memory management capabilities:

- Automatic cleanup based on configured strategies
- Scheduling of cleanup operations
- Strategy registration and execution

### CleanupStrategySpec.scala

Tests the various cleanup strategy implementations:

- Time-based access strategy (cleans up cells not accessed recently)
- Time-based modification strategy (cleans up cells not modified recently)
- Size-based strategy (cleans up cells exceeding size thresholds)
- Tag-based strategy (cleans up cells with specific tags)
- Strategy combinators:
  - `any` combinator (applies if any strategy matches)
  - `all` combinator (applies only if all strategies match)

### MemoryMonitorSpec.scala

Tests the memory monitoring and metrics collection system:

- Memory metrics collection (total cells, sizes, distributions)
- Multiple memory system monitoring
- Threshold-based alerts
- Historical metrics collection and analysis

## Circuit Pattern Tests

### CircuitMemorySpec.scala

Tests the low-level circuit memory operations:

- Bit-level packing and unpacking operations
- Efficient memory representation
- Error handling for invalid operations

### AgentCombinatorsSpec.scala

Tests the functional combinators for creating agent circuits:

- Basic transformations (`transform`)
- Conditional processing (`filter`)
- Sequential processing (`pipeline`)
- Parallel processing with result combination (`parallel`)
- Multi-stage processing (`shiftRegister`)
- Recursive processing (`feedback`)
- State management through `MemoryCell`

## LLM Integration Tests

### ClaudeAgentSpec.scala

Tests the integration with Anthropic's Claude model:

- Basic prompt processing
- Error handling
- Integration with the memory system

### VertexAIClientSpec.scala

Tests the integration with Google's Vertex AI:

- API communication
- Response handling
- Configuration management

## Application Tests

### SelfModifyingCLISpec.scala

Tests a practical application that can modify its own code:

- Command parsing and execution
- File operations with backup capabilities
- Self-modification safety features

### FileModificationServiceSpec.scala

Tests file modification utilities that support self-modifying applications:

- File reading and writing
- Backup and restoration
- Path validation and safety checks

## Test Coverage Assessment

### Well-Covered Areas

- Memory system and management
- Circuit patterns and agent combinators
- Basic LLM integration

### Areas Needing Additional Coverage

1. **End-to-End Agent Workflows**: More tests needed for complete agent interactions
2. **Agent-Specific Tests**: Dedicated tests for agent implementations are limited
3. **Dashboard Components**: Limited testing for visualization components

## Test Design Principles

The test suite follows several key design principles:

1. **Isolation**: Each test focuses on a specific component or behavior
2. **Composability**: Tests verify that components work correctly when combined
3. **Stability**: Tests use techniques like `TestClock` to ensure reliable time-based testing
4. **Resource Management**: Tests properly manage resources with ZIO's `acquireRelease` pattern

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using SBT:

```
sbt test                 # Run all tests
sbt "testOnly *MemorySystemSpec"  # Run a specific test suite
```

## Future Testing Improvements

1. Property-based testing for more exhaustive verification
2. Performance benchmarks for memory and transport systems
3. Simulation tests for complex agent interactions
4. More comprehensive integration tests across modules
