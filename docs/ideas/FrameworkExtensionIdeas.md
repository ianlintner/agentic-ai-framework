- **Iterative refinement** processes with human feedback

### Interface Mechanisms
- **Intent understanding agents** to interpret human requests
- **Explanation generation agents** for transparent reasoning
- **Visualization agents** to present complex information clearly

## 10. Implementation Examples

Concrete examples of how these ideas could be implemented:

### Document Processing Pipeline
```scala
// Create specialized document processing agents
val textExtractionAgent = ComposableAgent[Document, String](...)
val sentimentAnalysisAgent = ComposableAgent[String, SentimentResult](...)
val summaryGenerationAgent = ComposableAgent[String, String](...)
val translationAgent = ComposableAgent[String, String](...)

// Register with capability directory
val directory = ComposableAgentDirectory(capabilityRegistry)
directory.registerAgent(textExtractionAgent)
directory.registerAgent(sentimentAnalysisAgent)
directory.registerAgent(summaryGenerationAgent)
directory.registerAgent(translationAgent)

// Create dynamic workflows based on needs
val analyzeAndSummarizeWorkflow = 
  directory.createWorkflow[Document, String]("Document", "String", 
    Set("text-extraction", "summarization"))

val translateAndAnalyzeWorkflow = 
  directory.createWorkflow[String, SentimentResult]("String", "SentimentResult", 
    Set("translation", "sentiment-analysis"))
```

### Adaptive Customer Support System
```scala
// Define specialized support agents
val queryClassificationAgent = ComposableAgent[String, QueryCategory](...)
val knowledgeBaseAgent = ComposableAgent[QueryCategory, List[Article]](...)
val responseGenerationAgent = ComposableAgent[List[Article], String](...)
val sentimentDetectionAgent = ComposableAgent[String, CustomerSentiment](...)

// Create parallel processing for comprehensive analysis
val customerInteractionAnalysis = ComposableAgent.parallel(
  List(queryClassificationAgent, sentimentDetectionAgent),
  results => CustomerInteractionContext(results(0), results(1))
)

// Dynamic response generation based on customer needs
val supportWorkflow = customerInteractionAnalysis
  .andThen(contextualResponseAgent)
```

These examples demonstrate how the capability-based agent framework enables flexible, powerful AI systems that can be adapted to various domains and integrated with existing technologies.
