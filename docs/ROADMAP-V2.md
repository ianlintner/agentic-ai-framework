## Vision and Strategy

ZIO Agentic AI Framework Version 2 aims to transform the framework into a comprehensive platform for building distributed, autonomous agent systems based on modern Scala 3 and ZIO principles. Version 2 will expand on the foundational work of the initial release by delivering a fully-featured capability-based agent composition system, enhanced agent mesh networking, and sophisticated multi-agent coordination mechanisms.

The key strategic goals for Version 2 are:

1. **Enhanced Composability**: Enable seamless composition of specialized agents into complex workflows
2. **Improved Distributability**: Provide robust mesh networking for agents across different environments
3. **Advanced LLM Integration**: Deepen integration with leading LLM providers (Claude, Vertex AI, OpenAI)
4. **Enterprise Readiness**: Ensure security, monitoring, and performance meet enterprise requirements
5. **Developer Experience**: Create intuitive APIs, comprehensive documentation, and visual debugging tools

This roadmap outlines the execution plan to achieve these goals through a phased approach over an 8-month timeframe.
