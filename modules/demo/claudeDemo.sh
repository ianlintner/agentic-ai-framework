  echo "An agentic AI framework is a software architecture that allows AI models to act 
autonomously to achieve goals rather than just responding to queries. 

Key components include:

1. Memory systems that maintain context and historical information
2. Decision-making capabilities to determine appropriate actions
3. Tool-use interfaces to interact with external systems
4. Execution mechanisms to carry out selected actions

The framework provides the scaffolding that transforms a language model from being 
purely responsive to being proactive - able to plan, execute, and learn from sequences 
of actions to accomplish defined objectives.

This is a simulated response to demonstrate the Claude 3.7 integration concept.
The demonstration shows how we could integrate with Vertex AI to access Claude 3.7
capabilities within our Scala-based framework."
