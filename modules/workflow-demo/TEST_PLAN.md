# ZIO HTTP Workflow Demo Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategies for the ZIO HTTP Workflow Demo application. The test plan covers unit testing of server components, integration testing of API endpoints, UI/frontend testing approaches, and performance testing considerations.

## Unit Testing Strategies

### Server Components

#### WorkflowHttpServer
- Test server initialization and configuration
- Test middleware application (CORS)
- Test handling of malformed requests
- Test static file serving

#### WorkflowExecutionStore
- Test creation of workflow executions
- Test updating workflow progress
- Test completion of workflows
- Test handling workflow failures
- Test cancellation of workflows
- Test retrieval of workflow status

#### WebSocketManager
- Test subscription mechanism
- Test unsubscription (single and all)
- Test notification delivery
- Test handling of disconnected clients

### Workflow Engine Components

#### WorkflowEngine
- Test execution plan building from workflow definitions
- Test topological sort of workflow nodes
- Test handling of cycles in workflows
- Test execution of plans with different node types
- Test error handling during execution

#### WorkflowStep Implementations
- Test TextTransformStep execution
- Test TextSplitStep execution
- Test SummarizeStep execution
- Test PassthroughStep execution
- Test BuildStep execution

### Agent Testing

#### TextTransformerAgent
- Test different transformation types (capitalize, uppercase, lowercase)
- Test handling of empty input
- Test handling of large inputs

#### TextSplitterAgent
- Test different delimiter patterns
- Test edge cases (no delimiter found, empty input)

#### SummarizationAgent
- Test summarization of different text types
- Test handling of various input lengths

#### BuildAgent
- Test build process with different inputs
- Test error handling during build

## Integration Testing Strategies

### API Endpoints

#### Workflow Execution Endpoint
- Test successful workflow execution
- Test with invalid workflow definitions
- Test with empty input
- Test concurrent workflow execution requests

#### Status Endpoint
- Test status retrieval for existing workflows
- Test status retrieval for non-existent workflows
- Test status updates while workflow is running

#### Results Endpoint
- Test result retrieval for completed workflows
- Test result retrieval for running workflows
- Test result retrieval for failed workflows
- Test result retrieval for non-existent workflows

#### Cancel Endpoint
- Test cancellation of running workflows
- Test cancellation of already completed workflows
- Test cancellation of non-existent workflows

#### WebSocket Endpoint
- Test connection establishment
- Test receiving updates during workflow execution
- Test handling connection closures (client and server initiated)
- Test reconnection scenarios

### End-to-End Flow
- Test complete workflow execution from submission to completion
- Test workflow cancellation flow
- Test error handling and recovery

## UI/Frontend Testing Approaches

### Component Testing
- Test individual React components
  - Workflow Canvas
  - Node Components
  - Connection Components
  - Control Panel
  - Status Displays

### User Interaction Testing
- Test drag and drop functionality for creating workflow nodes
- Test connection creation between nodes
- Test workflow execution from UI
- Test cancellation from UI
- Test viewing results
- Test real-time updates via WebSockets

### Visual Regression Testing
- Test UI appearance across different browsers and screen sizes
- Verify that UI elements appear correctly after changes

### Accessibility Testing
- Test keyboard navigation
- Test screen reader compatibility
- Test color contrast

## Performance Testing Considerations

### Load Testing
- Test server performance under various load conditions
  - Concurrent workflow executions
  - Multiple WebSocket connections
  - Heavy workflows with many nodes
  
### Scalability Testing
- Test with increasing numbers of workflows
- Test with workflows of increasing complexity
- Measure response times under load

### Resource Utilization
- Monitor CPU usage during workflow execution
- Monitor memory consumption
- Monitor connection handling

### Latency Testing
- Measure end-to-end execution time
- Measure time for individual workflow steps
- Measure WebSocket update latency

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Test Environment
- Use ZIO Test framework for unit and integration tests
- Set up test fixtures for common workflow definitions
- Use mock implementations for agents when appropriate
- Use in-memory storage for workflow execution data

### Continuous Integration
- Run unit tests on every PR
- Run integration tests on main branch updates
- Run performance tests on release candidates

### Test Reporting
- Generate test coverage reports
- Track performance metrics over time
- Document any flaky tests
