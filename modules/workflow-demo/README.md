# Workflow Demo

## Overview

The Workflow Demo showcases the Agentic AI Framework's ability to connect specialized agents in a workflow to perform complex tasks. This demo illustrates how agents can be orchestrated to process text, summarize content, and execute build operations.

## ðŸš¨ Important Notice: ZIO HTTP Compatibility Issue

There is currently a compatibility issue with ZIO HTTP 3.0.0-RC2. The server code may not compile due to API changes. As a workaround, you can access the UI directly without the backend server.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Direct File Access (Recommended)

1. Open the local test HTML file directly in your browser:
   ```
   file:///Users/E74823/projects/agentic-ai-framework/modules/workflow-demo/src/main/resources/public/local-test.html
   ```

2. This version uses mock data to simulate workflow execution without requiring the backend server.

### Option 2: Run the Server (May Not Work)

1. Run the workflow demo server:
   ```
   ./modules/workflow-demo/run-workflow-demo.sh
   ```

2. Access the UI at: `http://localhost:8083/`

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs` directory:

- [Complete Documentation](docs/WorkflowDemo_Documentation.md)
- [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/WorkflowDemo_TroubleshootingGuide.md)

## Architecture

The Workflow Demo consists of:

1. **Frontend Interface**: A React application for creating and visualizing workflows
2. **Backend Server**: A Scala/ZIO application providing REST API endpoints
3. **Agent Components**: Specialized agents for text transformation, summarization, etc.
4. **Workflow Engine**: Coordinates agent execution according to defined workflows

## Available Agent Types

- **TextTransformerAgent**: Transforms text (capitalization, etc.)
- **TextSplitterAgent**: Splits text into manageable chunks
- **SummarizationAgent**: Creates summaries of text input
- **BuildAgent**: Simulates build processes

## REST API Endpoints (When Server is Running)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/workflow/execute` | POST | Execute a workflow |
| `/api/workflow/status/:id` | GET | Get status of a workflow execution |
| `/api/workflow/result/:id` | GET | Get the result of a completed workflow |
| `/api/workflow/progress/:id` | GET | Get the progress percentage of a workflow |
| `/api/workflow/cancel/:id` | POST | Cancel a running workflow |

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter the error "Error: Failed to fetch" when running a workflow, it typically means:

1. The workflow REST API server is not running
2. There's a CORS issue preventing the frontend from connecting to the backend
3. The frontend is using incorrect API endpoints
4. The ZIO HTTP server has compatibility issues (current scenario)
