# Workflow Demo Enhancements

This document describes the enhancements made to the Workflow Demo application.

## Overview of Changes

The Workflow Demo has been enhanced in several ways:

1. **Agent Configuration**: Agents now use the configuration from workflow nodes
2. **New Agent Type**: Added a Sentiment Analysis agent to demonstrate extensibility
3. **Improved UI**: Added a more user-friendly interface for working with workflows

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Agent Configuration

Previously, the TextTransformerAgent and TextSplitterAgent had hardcoded configurations and didn't use the configuration from the workflow nodes. Now:

- TextTransformerAgent has a configurable transformation (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize, reverse)
- TextSplitterAgent has a configurable delimiter
- The WorkflowEngine passes the configuration from the workflow nodes to the agents

This makes the workflow more flexible and demonstrates how different configurations can be applied to the same agent.

### 2. New Sentiment Analysis Agent

A new SentimentAnalysisAgent has been added to demonstrate the extensibility of the framework:

- Performs simple sentiment analysis on text based on positive and negative word counts
- Has two modes: "basic" and "detailed"
- Basic mode provides a simple sentiment assessment (Positive, Neutral, or Negative) with a score
- Detailed mode provides more granular sentiment categories and additional statistics

The default workflow has been updated to include a sentiment analysis node, demonstrating how the new agent can be integrated into a workflow.

### 3. Improved UI

The UI has been enhanced to provide a better user experience:

- Added a text area for entering input text
- Added a "Process Text" button to run the workflow
- Added a progress bar to show the workflow execution progress
- Added a section to display the workflow results

This makes it easier for users to interact with the workflow and see the results.

## How to Use the Enhanced Demo

1. Start the Workflow Demo server by running `./modules/workflow-demo/run-workflow-demo.sh`
2. Open the HTML file directly in your browser: `file:///Users/E74823/projects/agentic-ai-framework/modules/workflow-demo/src/main/resources/public/local-test.html`
3. Scroll down to the "Enhanced Workflow UI" section
4. Enter some text in the text area
5. Click the "Process Text" button
6. Watch the progress bar as the workflow executes
7. View the results when the workflow completes

## Example Input

Try the following example input to see the sentiment analysis in action:

```
This is a great example of a workflow. I love how it processes text and analyzes sentiment.
The results are amazing and the UI is very user-friendly.
```

This should produce a positive sentiment analysis result.
