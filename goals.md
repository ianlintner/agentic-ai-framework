THIS IS A SCALA 3 and ZIO Funcational Library. IT must be scala 3!

# Agentic AI Framework - Vision & Roadmap

## Core Vision

Our goal is to build a comprehensive, functional agentic AI framework for Scala using ZIO and category theory principles. Beyond just being a library, we aim to create a self-evolving system that achieves artificial general intelligence (AGI) capabilities within specialized domains. The framework will eventually evolve into being able to understand, maintain, and extend itself - effectively coding its own improvements based on examples, feedback, and observed patterns.

## Ambitious Long-Term Goals

- **AGI-like Domain Specialization**: Create specialized agents that approach AGI-level capabilities within bounded domains like software engineering, data analysis, and scientific research
- **Self-Improvement System**: Develop a framework that can analyze its own code, detect inefficiencies, and generate improvements
- **Emergent Meta-Learning**: Enable agents to develop novel problem-solving strategies through meta-learning that weren't explicitly programmed
- **Collective Intelligence Network**: Create a system where multiple specialized agents can collaborate, forming an emergent collective intelligence greater than the sum of its parts
- **Human-AI Cognitive Symbiosis**: Achieve a seamless integration between human cognition and AI capabilities, where each enhances the other's limitations

Features
* Agentic AI Plugin
* Memory Cell / Combinators to handle async information & commands
* Integration with common ai clients with zio wrappers openai, vertex gcp AI, azure open ai, possibly others if it makes sens
* Vecotr store zio client using an existing library if exists
* RAG zio client for embedings
* Example web apps with lots of demo data and debug information
* Example agent app that can eventually code itself like Roo or Cline based on issues in GitHub
* MCP integration 
* Easy to build agents for things like connecting to custom data warehouse when mcp doesn't exist
* Potentially prompt/text based ad-hoc agents
* Adhoc temporal agents created by other agents with a management lib
* Autonomous agent pipelines with self-healing capabilities
* Multi-modal agents that can process and generate text, code, images, and structured data
* Advanced reasoning agents with integrated Bayesian and causal inference
* Explainable AI components for transparency in agent decision-making
* Agent collaboration and negotiation protocols
* Regulatory and ethical compliance management systems

We want super detailed both easy to understand intro quickstart and nitty gritty details and academic theory of agentic theory, funcation programming, category theory and how to combine it all in our zio agentic system using lots of mermaid charts diagrams think college level of text detailed.

We want practical examples to make these concepts easy to understand.

Always be buildable and testable

## Research Innovations

Our framework will push the boundaries of several computer science fields:

- **Category Theoretical Foundations**: Apply advanced concepts from category theory (monads, functors, natural transformations) to create a mathematically rigorous foundation for agent composition
- **Type-Level Agent Programming**: Develop a type system that can express and verify agent capabilities and constraints at compile-time
- **Formal Verification of Agent Behavior**: Implement techniques to formally verify the safety and correctness of agent actions
- **Quantum-Inspired Probabilistic Programming**: Incorporate quantum computing principles for probabilistic reasoning in uncertainty scenarios
- **Neurosymbolic Integration**: Bridge neural networks and symbolic reasoning in a functionally pure framework
